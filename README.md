## About the Project <a name="about-the-project"></a>

This project features a unique robot capable of seamlessly transitioning between a humanoid form and a vehicle form. Standing 70 cm tall and weighing 3.25 kg, the robot combines entertainment and interactivity with practicality.

The robot is designed to provide a fun and engaging user experience, recognizing faces, waving hello, and responding to voice commands like “Transform” using TinyML technology. Entirely wireless, it can be controlled through a web interface hosted on a Pico W, making it adaptable to various environments and perfect for delivering entertainment with a practical twist.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Transformation Functionality from Humanoid to Car and Vice Versa
- IoT integration and I2C communication between boards are successfully implemented.
- TinyML has been successfully implemented on the microphone to recgonize The word "Transform"
- Pico W Web server that controls the robot wirelessly and shows if there is a human in from of him real-time

## What is in the Repo <a name="repo"></a>

- **Bottom: Arduino Nano RP 2040; contains logic for the bottom half of the robot**
  - Servo Cluster: code to control multiple servos simultaneously
  - Servo.h, Servo.cpp: main code to initialize the servos
- **Microphone: Mic Driver for Arduino Nano RP 2040 in a separate project**
  - Microphone.h, Microphone.c: Arduino Nano RP 2040 Mic Module Driver
- **IOT: RP Pico W Project Directory; contains logic for the top half of the robot and IOT integration**
  - Camera.h, Camera.cpp: Face Detection Module Driver
  - WIFI: driver to enable the WIFI connection to control all operations for transformations and camera detection
- **Top (included in IOT Folder): Raspberry Pi Pico Project Directory; contains logic for the top half of the robot**
  - Servo Cluster: code to control multiple servos simultaneously
  - Servo.h Servo.cpp: the main code to initialize the servos
  - DC Motor Control (included in IOT Folder): Rasperry Pi Pico; contains the logic for the vehicle form movement
  - DcMotor.h DcMotor.cpp: DC Motor Driver
- **Communication and I2C**
  - Communication: sends the WIFI transformation signal to the Arduino Nano RP2040
  - I2C: get a message from the Master (Arduino Nano RP2040) to perform some operation
- **Face Recognition Module: RP 3 Model B**
  - The code in the Raspberry PI 3 that uses OpenCV for facial recognition
