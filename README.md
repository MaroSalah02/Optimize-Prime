## About the Project <a name="about-the-project"></a>

This project features a unique robot capable of seamlessly transitioning between a humanoid form and a vehicle form. Standing 70 cm tall and weighing 3.25 kg, the robot combines entertainment and interactivity with practicality.

The robot is designed to provide a fun and engaging user experience, recognizing faces, waving hello, and responding to voice commands like “Transform” using TinyML technology. Entirely wireless, it can be controlled through a web interface hosted on a Pico W, making it adaptable to various environments and perfect for delivering entertainment with a practical twist.
